      <p class="story-intro">
        Before the team's season descends even farther into despair, the manager need to be given the opportunity to go.
      </p>
      <img src="https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1433916977/photo/madrid-spain-head-coach-xavi-hernandez-of-fc-barcelona-looks-on-dejected-during-the-laliga.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=2Lysgwx3jn-WbzTtb0BYWrcWhCKkJXaisKIvVKMpkwM=" alt="xavi-barca" class="storyImg">
      <div class="story-explanation">
   
        <p>Xavi got up, turned around, yelled at the referee, and slammed his seat in the dugout during the 45th minute of Barcelona's La Liga match against Granada on Sunday. His wrath was well-founded; Barca had let in another soft goal, which gave a relegation candidate the opportunity to dart down the right flank, pass the ball into the middle, and score past Marc-Andre ter Stegen, the current La Liga MVP.</p>
       <p>Barcelona's season has been marred by a 3-3 draw, with Real Madrid leading the way. The Champions League is uncertain, with a tie with Napoli in the last 16, and even if they win, it's unlikely they will win the European Cup. Xavi's resignation, injuries, and Girona's rise in the table further complicate the situation. The club's current state is messy, as has been the case over the past half-decade.</p>
       <p>Xavi, a manager who brought immense success last season, is at the center of an on-field mess at Barca. The team has not built on their glory this year, and regression is unacceptable. The job has taken a toll on Xavi's mental health and the pressure of being the face of one of the world's biggest brands. Club president Joan Laporta is losing patience, and Xavi should leave now rather than waiting until summer.</p>
      

       <img src="https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1967987862/photo/barcelona-spain-head-coach-xavi-hernandez-of-fc-barcelona-looks-on-during-the-laliga-ea.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=BrWbwg8hM_OttuMvW5o4fkfBl8f0uXgG1HRhwB4ctho=" alt="madrid-spain-head-coach-xavi-hernandez-of-fc-barcelona-looks-on-dejected-during-the-laliga" class="storyImg">
     

       <p>In early January, Xavi announced his resignation in a sullen statement following a 5-3 home defeat to Villarreal. He stated that Barcelona had reached a point of no return and it was time for change. Xavi spoke with the board and the club today, and he will leave on June 30. He expressed that he felt he was holding the team back and could sense the uncertainty around the club. He also believed that the media had made his job impossible and that he could no longer cope with the pressure. Xavi admitted that the demands of his position made him feel worthless and that he believed that letting Xavi walk immediately was the only answer.</p>

  <p>He has expressed concerns about the stress he is facing as a manager, citing the struggles of his predecessors Luis Enrique, Ernesto Valverde, and Pep Guardiola. Guardiola, who announced his intention to leave Camp Nou 12 years ago, cited exhaustion and a need for recharge</p>

  <p>Xavi's comments came at a time of immense success, after four memorable seasons in Barcelona's history. He believes he is holding the team back, causing uncertainty, and that the media has made his job impossible. He also feels he cannot cope with the pressure of his position, stating that it is not enjoyable and risky. Xavi's departure is now a human question, and he believes letting him walk immediately is the only answer.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Barcelona finds itself at a standstill, although not in a state of crisis. Despite concerns about inconsistent performances and vulnerabilities on both offense and defense, they are expected to comfortably secure qualification for the Champions League next season. Despite trailing league leaders Madrid by 10 points, Xavi's side maintains a five-point lead over fifth-placed Athletic Club.</p>

<p>With the third-highest goal tally in La Liga, largely attributed to Robert Lewandowski, who has scored 10 league goals despite speculation about a potential decline, Barcelona's prospects seem promising. Additionally, 16-year-old Lamine Yamal has been instrumental in securing several recent victories, suggesting long-term potential for the team.</p>

<p>Although Laporta voices discontent over Barcelona's current standing, he acknowledges the club's underperformance. Despite their talent and potential to contend for league titles, criticism is directed towards Xavi's tactical rigidity and squad mismanagement. However, the club remains resilient and may regain form in the upcoming weeks.</p>

<p>Barcelona's midfield trio of De Jong, Pedri, and Ilkay Gundogan has shown flashes of brilliance, while promising talent like Lamine Yamal and Vitor Roque offer hope for the future. Xavi has demonstrated tactical flexibility by deploying players like Andreas Christensen and Hector Fort in new roles.</p>

<p>Despite these efforts, Barcelona's crisis stems from a lack of confidence rather than a complete breakdown in performance. A managerial change may provide the necessary rejuvenation for the team, with options like Hansi Flick and Marcelo Gallardo being considered.</p>

<p>Although a managerial change poses risks, it could revitalize Barcelona's fortunes and elevate the team to greater heights. The allure of managing Messi and competing for league titles may have diminished, but promising options exist to lead the club forward.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Barcelona stands at a crossroads, with Xavi's departure offering a potential turning point. A new manager could inject fresh ideas and motivation into the team, benefiting both the players and the club as a whole.</p>
