      <p class="story-intro">
        After the Reds were denied Romeo Lavia and Moises Caicedo by the Blues, they were made fun of, but now Jurgen Klopp is grinning.
          </p>
      <div class="story-explanation">
        <p>
            When Jurgen Klopp addressed Liverpool supporters at a December event, he openly admitted that the club's midfield restructuring had exceeded his expectations. Reflecting on the summer transfer window, he conceded, "We encountered some unusual situations in the transfer market." However, speaking candidly, Klopp expressed gratitude, saying, "My god, were we lucky, eh?!" He acknowledged that although things seemed uncertain at the time, he's pleased with how it turned out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Klopp's sense of relief is understandable. Liverpool started the season with a glaring gap in midfield, prompting concerns. Jamie Carragher remarked on the club's recruitment strategy, noting they had "made a mess" of it, failing to secure targets like Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, with the latter situation being particularly farcical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carragher went as far as to label the situation "a joke," underscoring the frustration felt at Anfield. The initial excitement generated by the swift signings of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai during the summer transfer window had turned into embarrassment as Liverpool struggled to address their midfield deficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, Liverpool managed to rectify the situation by bringing in a specialist No.6, but the delay in addressing the issue left a blemish on their transfer dealings.
          </p>
<img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt80648ecc705b940f/64e0e23ac818d63d5f390ec5/endo_wataru_liverpool.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=70" class="storyImg">          
<p>
    Was Wataru Endo a 'top fit' or just a stop-gap solution? Upon his arrival, Endo was 30 years old and joining from struggling Stuttgart. Many saw him as a temporary fix, a move borne out of desperation rather than strategic planning. Consequently, a considerable number of supporters were left feeling underwhelmed - a sentiment Klopp was well aware of.
  </p>
  <p>
    Addressing fans' concerns, Klopp defended the decision, acknowledging the preference for high-profile signings. However, he emphasized Endo's qualities, highlighting his experience as captain of Stuttgart and Japan, proficiency in English, amiable personality, and exceptional work ethic on the pitch. Despite the skepticism, Klopp expressed confidence in Endo's ability to make an immediate impact, citing his positive attitude and suitability for the team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet, Endo's late arrival at Anfield inevitably posed challenges. The adjustment period hindered his integration into the squad and limited his early contributions.
  </p>
  <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt76cffe7012f28111/65d10cd8c0e3bc040ad56dd0/Jurgen-Klopp.jpeg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=70" class="storyImg">          
  <p>
    Adapting to Jurgen Klopp's footballing philosophy can be a challenge for many players, especially defensive midfielders, as Klopp demands a lot from his No.6s. Fabinho's early struggles in the holding role serve as a reminder of this, as he initially found it difficult before eventually becoming a linchpin in Klopp's successful Liverpool team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Klopp acknowledged that he may have made Wataru Endo's adaptation even more challenging by thrusting him into the deep end. Endo's first two appearances for Liverpool came in games where the team was reduced to 10 men, against Bournemouth and Newcastle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Klopp also admitted that his previous comments about Endo being "very calm and very polite" may have inadvertently created pressure. Reflecting on this, Klopp expressed dissatisfaction with his previous remarks, clarifying that Endo is indeed a top player and deserves time to settle.
  </p>
  <p>
    "If we don't give people time anymore, what world is this?" Klopp questioned. Despite the initial hurdles, Endo has demonstrated his quality over the past three months, proving himself as a valuable asset for Liverpool.
  </p>
  <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt119031dc73deeee1/65b8d4361dbfd4040abe7b2a/endo-news.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=90" class="storyImg">        
  <p>
    Despite seeing limited game time in September and October, Wataru Endo's influence grew significantly by the time the Asian Cup arrived in January. Jurgen Klopp jokingly expressed his desire for Japan to exit the tournament early so that Endo could return to Liverpool sooner. "If I wished you luck, it would be a lie!" Klopp quipped, highlighting Endo's importance to the team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Klopp's frustration was understandable as Endo had become an indispensable part of Liverpool's squad, which was competing on multiple fronts and sitting atop the table. Endo's impact was evident when he came off the bench to score a crucial late equalizer in the 4-3 victory over Fulham. He then started six consecutive games before departing for the Asian Cup.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon his return from the tournament, Endo immediately reclaimed his spot in the starting lineup for Liverpool's recent victories over Burnley, Brentford, and Luton Town. Klopp's eagerness to prove doubters wrong was palpable, given Endo's rapid rise from limited involvement to essential player.
  </p>
  <p>
    Klopp's praise for Endo's resilience and contribution reflected the player's remarkable journey, silencing critics who had prematurely dismissed him.
  </p>
  <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blteeded2842a2d6ca6/65c130346fda6c040a4f08c9/GOAL_-_Blank_WEB_-_Facebook.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=70" class="storyImg">        
  <p>
    Alexis Mac Allister's deployment as a No.6 has sparked intense debate since Liverpool's season opener against Chelsea. The £35m midfielder showcased his versatility and intelligence, contributing to Luis Diaz's opening goal at Stamford Bridge. However, Chelsea asserted dominance in midfield.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mac Allister responded impressively to the initial uncertainty, delivering a series of influential performances in front of Liverpool's defense. By the time Liverpool faced Chelsea again in the Premier League, Klopp was singing Mac Allister's praises, hailing him as one of the best defensive midfielders in the league.
  </p>
  <p>
    Klopp emphasized Mac Allister's intelligence, describing him as "incredibly smart." Despite not playing the conventional No.6 role at Brighton, Mac Allister's adaptability shines through. Klopp lauded his abilities both on and off the ball, highlighting his exceptional skill set and effectiveness in creating a compact formation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Klopp's confidence in Mac Allister's defensive capabilities underscores the midfielder's importance to Liverpool's tactical setup, further solidifying his position as a key player in the team.
  </p>
  <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blte7bc411b81df3fee/65c7a9b99e94fc040a5f4f77/GettyImages-2000219322.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=60" class="storyImg">        
  <p>
    The way Alexis Mac Allister dominated Moises Caicedo at Anfield last month was remarkable, with the struggling Ecuadorian substituted off after just 66 minutes of misery. It's worth noting that Mac Allister doesn't even consider defensive midfield his primary position, yet he's outperformed the £115m specialist signed for that role this season.
  </p>
  <p>
    Considering Wataru Endo's similar success in midfield, it's evident why Jurgen Klopp views missing out on Caicedo and Romeo Lavia as a blessing in disguise. Lavia, bought from Southampton for £60m, has been sidelined with injury, seeing only 32 minutes of action this season.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reflecting on the situation in December, Klopp humorously remarked, "We obviously realized that other central defensive midfielders don't want to join Liverpool!" However, the discovery of Endo, whom Klopp describes as an exceptional player, has turned the tide.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Liverpool gears up for Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Chelsea, the performances of Mac Allister and Endo have silenced any doubts. Their success contrasts starkly with the hefty sums their rivals spent on Caicedo, Lavia, and Enzo Fernandez, who arrived for £107m in a bid to revamp their midfield. While Chelsea may have won the transfer battle last summer, Liverpool's unexpected successes have turned them into the ultimate lucky losers.
