      <p class="story-intro">
        While they try to invest the extra money he'll leave behind, the Parisians have plenty of alternatives even though they're losing a club great.

        The loss of Kylian Mbappe is detrimental to Paris Saint-Germain.
         They will lose the face of French football, a global sensation, and the club's all-time leading striker.
         The money they can now spend to add more details to the side gives them some comfort, though. The Parisians are prepared to invest heavily on an extensive rebuilding project this summer now that Mbappe's enormous pay has been disclosed. They are looking for a top-tier attacker, a midfielder, and maybe a long-term center-back to replace Marquinhos, according to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano.
 As a result, who are the players PSG is probably going to be pursuing in the summer transfer window as they look to replace Mbappe?

      <b>Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)</b><br>
      <p>
        Marcus Rashford of Manchester United has attracted interest from PSG for quite some time now. The Parisian club has repeatedly expressed interest in acquiring the services of Manchester United's left-sided forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite Rashford's undeniable talent, there's a feeling that his progress has been hindered by the instability within his current club. Manchester United's constant upheavals and lack of cohesion have limited individuals' ability to excel. While the recent partial takeover by Sir Jim Ratcliffe promises a sense of stability, it remains uncertain if Rashford can reach his peak performance while at Old Trafford.
      </p>
      <p>
        A move to PSG could offer a promising pathway for Rashford. With Kylian Mbappe's departure, Rashford could assume a central role in the team. Additionally, PSG's style under manager Luis Enrique, which emphasizes direct, counter-attacking football, aligns well with Rashford's strengths, particularly his pace and ability to exploit spaces behind opposition defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the tactical appeal of a potential move, a departure from Old Trafford for Rashford seems improbable. He has deep roots at Manchester United and only recently signed a lucrative contract extension less than a year ago. Despite experiencing inconsistent form during the 2023-24 season, it's unlikely that the allure of Paris would sway Rashford, given his loyalty to his current club.
      </p>
      <img src="https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1466082059/photo/milan-italy-rafael-leao-of-ac-milan-celebrates-after-the-teams-first-goal-scored-by-teammate.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=PRvhAgpI45Ju9OqJTW6NJsk1KAc5X95p_D3A_uFLaG4=" class="storyImg">
     
      <b>Rafael Leao (AC Milan)</b><br>
      <p>
        Recent reports linking PSG with Marcus Rashford suggest that the Parisian club is seeking a direct replacement for Kylian Mbappe. However, in reality, Rafael Leao appears to be a better fit for such a role. The AC Milan standout differs from Mbappe in several aspects; he's taller, stronger, and possesses superior passing ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these differences, Leao and Mbappe share certain characteristics. Both excel as dribblers, displaying a willingness to take on defenders, particularly when afforded space to exploit. At 24 years old, Leao still has ample room for growth and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, there are valid concerns to address. While Leao is proficient in scoring goals, he has yet to surpass the 20-goal mark in a single season. Furthermore, his effectiveness against defensive setups like the low blocks frequently encountered by PSG remains uncertain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, if PSG's intention is to secure a prominent left-sided forward capable of replicating Mbappe's impact, Leao could potentially fulfill that role.
      </p>
      <img src="https://media.gettyimages.com/id/1474597542/photo/turin-italy-victor-osimhen-of-ssc-napoli-celebrates-after-scoring-the-teams-first-goal-during.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=iffBSwqYyw5uthg94tT0eDifLAvSSfh5MZXRR5VSK8M=" class="storyImg">
      <b>Victor Osimhen (Napoli)</b><br>
      <p>
        It's no secret that Victor Osimhen will be departing Napoli at the conclusion of the season. The pressing question now is: where will he land next? Chelsea and Arsenal emerge as the primary contenders, both in dire need of a top-class No.9, with Osimhen standing out as the premier option on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, PSG cannot be disregarded. Despite scattered rumors, The Athletic among those reporting PSG's interest, the Parisians remain in contention for Osimhen's signature. The presence of football advisor Luis Campos, who previously signed Osimhen during his tenure at Lille, adds weight to the speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Osimhen's tactical suitability for PSG may not be perfect, given his proficiency as a central striker, his attributes align closely with those of a modern, dominant No.9. His potential arrival could pose a challenge to the playing time of Goncalo Ramos and Randal Kolo Muani, two significant signings for PSG last summer who are yet to fully deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, if PSG's aim is to secure the most prolific goal-scorer available to fill the void left by Mbappe, Osimhen stands as the ideal candidate.
      </p>
