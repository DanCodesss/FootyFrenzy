      <p class="story-intro">
        Liverpool's kids beat the 'blue billion pound bottle jobs'!<br>
        Despite having plenty of opportunities to win the match, Jurgen Klopp was the one celebrating at the end instead of Mauricio Pochettino's team.
      </p>
      <div class="story-explanation">
       <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltba38799c8990338c/65db997b341e85040ac5f368/GOAL_-_Multiple_Images_-_3_Stacked_-_Facebook_(81).jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=60" class="storyImg">
       
      <p>It was evident that Jurgen Klopp was thrilled as the full-time whistle blew. Despite all the challenges they faced both ahead of and during the match, Liverpool had somehow succeeded in taking home the Carabao Cup trophy from Chelsea.</p> 
      <p>The Blues will never get over their inability to at least register a point at Wembley, as Mauricio Pochettino's team spurned an absurd number of opportunities on an incredibly depressing afternoon for their fans.</p>
     <p>The Blues will always be disappointed that they were unable to at least draw a point at Wembley, as Mauricio Pochettino's squad wasted a ridiculous amount of chances on what was a really disappointing afternoon for their supporters.</p>
     <p>With three more trophies still to win, Klopp can now look forward to capping out his storied era at Anfield on a historic high. The pain never stops for Chelsea, and things truly didn't have to go this way.</p>
    
     <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltdf55164f8f61020a/65db6c6581fc55040a1b0397/GOAL_-_Blank_WEB_-_Facebook_-_2024-02-25T163457.370.png?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=60" class="storyImg">
       <p>Van Dijk's arrival on Merseyside helped Klopp's team reach new heights, so it makes sense that he was the player to step up big when his manager most needed a hero. The Reds were holding on for dear life as Chelsea peppered their goalmouth in the hour before the Dutchman's 118th-minute winner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wataru Endo was deemed to have obstructed Levi Colwill while in an offside position in the first half, depriving Van Dijk of a potentially game-changing opportunity.</p>
<p>Still, Van Dijk is a first-class honours graduate of Klopp's'mentality monsters' finishing school and he always understands when to take the game to the next level. And so he rose to the occasion in the final seconds of extra time, leaving Djordje Petrovic with no chance to stop him in the Chelsea goal. Van Dijk's classic moment in a red shirt is the most recent in a long run of them. How obedient he has been to Liverpool and Klopp.</p>

     <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltd8091f19c58317da/65db8c17ad7e96040a03574a/GOAL_-_Blank_WEB_-_Facebook_-_2024-02-25T195028.109.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=60" class="storyImg">
     <p>Gallagher must have watched Van Dijk's dramatic winner and thought to himself, "that could have been me." The Englishman wasn't the only Chelsea player guilty of poor finishing on Sunday, but he was clearly the worst offender.</p>

<p>Late in the second half, Gallagher had two golden opportunities to secure victory for his team, but on both occasions, he failed to capitalize. His first attempt, a clever snapshot following a well-executed cutback, struck the post.</p>

<p>His second miss was even more egregious, as he fired straight at Kelleher while one-on-one with the Liverpool goalkeeper. His time on the pitch in extra-time was brief, and the tired shake of his head as he walked off spoke volumes.</p>
     <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltd2d942b122eb8630/65db9be9ffab88040a07a91d/GOAL_-_Multiple_Images_-_2_Split_-_Facebook_-_2024-02-25T184229.790.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=60" class="storyImg">
     <p>This match was filled to the brim with exceptional goalkeeping performances. Caoimhin Kelleher, currently in a rich vein of form that begs the question why he settles for being a second choice, set the tone early on. He made himself big to deny Cole Palmer from close range after a fine setup from Raheem Sterling.</p>

<p>But that was just the beginning. Kelleher elevated his game even further in the second half. When Gallagher found himself in acres of space courtesy of Cole Palmer's pass with four minutes remaining, the Red half of Wembley held its breath. However, Kelleher once again denied the opportunity. There was yet another crucial save before the end of the 90 minutes, as Kelleher grabbed the ball like a magnet at the conclusion of a chaotic goalmouth scramble.</p>

<p>Yet, it wasn't solely about Liverpool's backup goalkeeper. Djordje Petrovic, a player few would have expected to feature regularly for the Blues at the season's outset, had a remarkable afternoon. Extraordinary moments unfolded in extra time, with the Serbian goalkeeper using his feet to miraculously prevent Harvey Elliot's header from finding the back of the net. Despite eventually conceding a goal, Petrovic's performance was a testament to the excellence of the goalkeeper's union.</p>
 
     <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltfd380219c238a962/65db538e1bf4cf040aedd5fb/GOAL_-_Multiple_Images_-_2_Split_-_Facebook-33.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=60" class="storyImg">
     <p>The beautiful, intricately embroidered banner in the Liverpool end bore his likeness, but on the pitch, the Reds' Egyptian King was conspicuously absent. While Mohamed Salah may have taken pleasure in witnessing Van Dijk nod home that dramatic winner, it undoubtedly marked a bittersweet day for one of the Premier League's most prominent stars.</p>

<p>However, Salah was far from alone in his frustration at being forced to watch from the sidelines at Wembley. Darwin Nunez, who has been in stellar form recently, Dominik Szoboszlai, Alisson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, and Curtis Jones were among the other notable absentees from Klopp's lineup, though the list could be extended.</p>

<p>Many of these players share special bonds with Klopp, and they are keenly aware that time is slipping away for them to forge more memories together. Thus, missing out on this Wembley showcase will undoubtedly be a tough pill to swallow.</p>

     <img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt8079a841b31a9e84/65db6517beb633040a0d8110/GOAL_-_Multiple_Images_-_2_Split_-_Facebook_-_2024-02-25T170337.007.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=60" class="storyImg">
     <p>Amidst this severe injury crisis, the last thing Klopp needed was another player consigned to the treatment table. Unfortunately, Liverpool's recent luck dictated otherwise, as less than 30 minutes into the game, Ryan Gravenberch collapsed following a reckless challenge from Moises Caicedo.</p>

<p>Remarkably, Caicedo escaped without receiving a yellow card for the incident. However, there was no such luck for Gravenberch, who had to be stretchered off the field. With midfield options already dangerously depleted, Liverpool can only hope that the injury isn't as serious as it appeared.</p>
<img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt386b24f994dbeb19/65db8c445fb239040a119224/GOAL_-_Blank_WEB_-_Facebook_-_2024-02-25T185056.457.png?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=60" class="storyImg">
<p>Casual football enthusiasts tuning in for the final on Sunday might have found themselves bewildered by some of the players donning the Red shirts. The youthful makeup of Liverpool's starting XI was striking.</p>

<p>Jarell Quansah, at just 21, and Conor Bradley, a mere 20 years old, led the pack, with Bobby Clark, James McConnell, and Jayden Danns even younger. Despite the daunting Wembley spotlight, not one of these young talents appeared overwhelmed or out of their depth in terms of tactics, technique, or physicality.</p>

<p>Bradley, the sole starter among the quintet, particularly stood out, especially before Gravenberch's injury disrupted the team's rhythm. However, each of Quansah, Clark, McConnell, and Danns proved themselves worthy of their winner's medal on this occasion. The future looks exceptionally bright at Anfield.</p>

<img src="https://assets.goal.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/bltcea321481084e9c6/64d90ddc6bbdf72ab936c3a8/GettyImages-1612109655.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1080&quality=60" class="storyImg">
<p>Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville has delivered some memorable lines over the years, but his recent quip, "Klopp's kids against the blue billion-pound bottle jobs," might just be his finest work yet. While it's a simplistic view, it's not far from the truth.</p>

<p>Since assuming ownership of the Blues, Boehly has spared no expense in his quest to revive Chelsea's glory days. Victory on Sunday could have marked the initial stride on that arduous journey, but instead, Chelsea's season now hangs precariously, with their only hope of redemption resting on FA Cup progression.</p>

<p>The outcome at Wembley will undoubtedly sting for Boehly, especially considering that nearly everything seemed to align in Chelsea's favor – save for that disallowed Raheem Sterling goal, of course. Liverpool suffered significant injuries and lost Gravenberch early on, while the Blues also benefited from some refereeing decisions, including Van Dijk's annulled goal, and created numerous scoring opportunities.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Pochettino's squad couldn't seal the deal. As the saying goes, if it looks and smells like a bottle job, it probably is one, as harsh as that assessment may be.</p>
